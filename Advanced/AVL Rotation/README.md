# AVL Rotation
Shubh had decided that he wanted to give back to society so he organised a tree plantation drive. But on the same weekend, his CS professor decided to give him a surprise assignment based on AVL rotation. Shubh is very tensed because he cannot manage both of them at the same time.

Can you help Shubh fulfill his aim of planting hundred's of trees by completing his assignment for him?

You can check out the functions you need to implement in ```AVL.h``` . Feel free to add more declarations or change the parameters of some functions as per your need. 

You need to submit 2 files: ```github_username.h``` which contains your version of ```AVL.h``` and ```github_username.cpp``` in which you will implement the required functions.
