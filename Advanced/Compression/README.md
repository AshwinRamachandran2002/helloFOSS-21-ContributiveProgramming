# Huffman Encoding

Maria had just returned to hostel after teaching children(and thus inculcating a better tomorrow) in the humble backgrounds around Insti.
She soon realized that her boyfriend, Jash was really pissed at her for leaving him(again!) to go and teach these children(even though she felt that it was the best utilization of her time!)

In order to set matters straight, Maria decided to download Maria's favorite story, Sherlock Holmes and read it to him at night.
Although she soon realized that her kindle had very less storage left, but the determined Maria who had just learnt about Huffman Encoding in CS 213 won't give up.

She started building a Huffman Encoder-Decoder but as tired as she was, she dosed off to sleep.

Now its in your hands to finish it for her, so that Jash is no longer outraged and she could continue teaching these children.

Head to ```huffman.h``` to find declarations about the classes you need to implement in order to help Maria and thus, the future of children of humble backgrounds around Insti.

You'll need to implement the required functions in ```huffman.cpp``` file, push it to your repository and create a Pull Request in order to contribute.

You could read more about Huffman Encoding from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).
