# Deletion in B-Tree

Subarno was fed-up with the pile-up of Hard Drives that surrounded his place so he decided to recycle them and make some money, which he could later donate towards some greater cause.

He found that many of these hard-drives were thrown away by their users just because they were out of space, so he decided to clean them up.

As it turns out Hard Drives store data in so-called, Disk-Based Data Structures. [B-Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) are one of the data structures of this kind.

Being the Programming prodigy that Subarno is, he did manage to complete the code for Inserting BTree, but is struggling with the deletion part.

Help him Delete from the B-Trees in order to recycle the hard disks.

You can learn more about Deletion in B-Trees from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKa_t7fF8o0).

We've already wrote the code for insertion in ```BTree.cpp``` .
You may also add the code for deletion and then test it with a main function there itself.

For submission : Push your own versions of ```BTree.h``` and ```BTree.cpp``` on your own clone of this repository and then create a Pull request.
